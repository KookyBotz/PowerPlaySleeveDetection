<h3 align="center">Signal Sleeve Detection Template</h3>

# About the project
This year for PowerPlay, one of the tasks teams have to complete is coming up with a way to detect their custom signal sleeve, placed on top of a cone for the autonomous period. To speed up the process, I created this example signal sleeve template, along with code to show how to use it, and an attached picture of the signal sleeve being used, so that any team can instantly download our code, print out the signal sleeve, and with a little tuning be ready to go for auto. 

Another common problem this plans to help out with is the use of the TensorFlow by rookies hoping to detect the signal sleeve. 

Here's why:
* TensorFlow can be slow, causing it to not work as well at times
* Without the right tuning and models, might be innacurate
* Rookies are unable to debug it by themselves, leading to it being hard to learn

This template exists to help give rookies a start when it comes to detecting signal sleeves efficiently and effectively.

Use the `VisionTest.java` and `SleeveDetection.java` to get started.
